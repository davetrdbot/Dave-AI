# Dave — Build Progress

This file tracks progress through the DAVE master build prompt, step by step.
Per the master prompt: work through numbered steps IN ORDER, verify each with
real proof before moving on, report back after each step individually.

## Status: Step 1 — Research Phase (COMPLETE, awaiting user confirmation before Step 2)

Started: 2026-09-04 · Research completed: 2026-09-04

### Step 1 checklist
- [x] 1.1 AirLLM (Qwen3-235B MoE loader bug status, VRAM/disk/RAM tradeoffs, integration steps) — no confirmed open bug found; disk I/O is the real bottleneck
- [x] 1.2 DeepSeek Harness (DSH) — Cordis plugin architecture — confirmed real, matches module names in prompt
- [x] 1.3 Sandbox decision: Alibaba OpenSandbox vs DSH native sandbox — recommend DSH native sandbox, revisit only if it lacks browser automation
- [x] 1.4 Hermes Agent memory architecture (frozen MEMORY.md/USER.md pattern) — confirmed real (NousResearch), pattern matches spec
- [x] 1.5 TencentDB Agent Memory (4-tier L0-L3 pipeline) — confirmed real (TencentCloud)
- [x] 1.6 Telegram Bot API — rich messages, streaming drafts, buttons, commands, profile picture — findings need live-bot re-verification before Step 8 (see research-summary.md)
- [x] 1.7 Prompt caching mechanics — confirmed static-first/dynamic-last across Anthropic/OpenAI/DeepSeek
- [x] 1.8 Voice: Fish Audio / ElevenLabs (TTS) + STT for voice note transcription — recommend OpenAI transcription API for STT
- [x] 1.9 Write research-summary.md, confirm understanding before Step 2 — done, see research-summary.md; PAUSED here for user sign-off per master prompt process

Real proof: see `research-summary.md` for full findings, each with sources.
Two web-research passes were run in parallel; a third finding (Telegram's
`sendRichMessageDraft`/`<tg-thinking>`/`setMyProfilePhoto`) is flagged for
mandatory live re-verification against a real bot before Step 8, since it's
surprisingly well-matched to the prompt's own phrasing and should not be
trusted on search results alone.

### Notes / open decisions
- WhatsApp voice calling (Green API + Gemini Live) — NOT reconfirmed as part of final
  architecture. Flagging as pending decision per master prompt §"OPEN QUESTION". Do not
  build until user explicitly confirms.
- Trading rules are NOT to be authored by Claude. goal.yaml stays an empty placeholder
  until the user uploads their own rules .md file.
- DAVEMA skill/reference document has not yet been provided — Step 7 blocked until it is.
